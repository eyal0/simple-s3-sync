# simple-s3-sync
Simple S3 Sync (aka S5) helps you sync files between Amazon's S3 service and your computer.

There are multiple sync modes depending on what you want to do when the files are newer on your computer, on AWS, etc.  File hashes are checked before any transfer so that files that don't need updating aren't sent.
